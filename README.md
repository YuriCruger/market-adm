# Market Adm

## About the project
This project was developed as part of my studies. It offers a complete authentication system, allowing users to create accounts and recover passwords. The main interface presents a product table, where it is possible to add new items, delete them, and apply search filters.

The second page of the project is a control panel that displays relevant information about the products. One of the highlights is a graph that shows the distribution of products by category.

The project is fully integrated with Firebase, both for user authentication and for the database that stores product information.
